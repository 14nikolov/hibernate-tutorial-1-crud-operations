		- company : varchar



Steps You Must Complete

	2. Set up the Hibernate configuration file.   

	3. Create a Java class (entity) with Hibernate annotations.   

	4. Develop a main application.   

	5. Develop code to save objects.   

	6. Develop code to retrieve an object by primary key.   

	7. Develop code to query objects to find employees for a given company.   

	8. Develop code to delete an object by primary key. 

 
The application should use the same style and approach as shown in the videos.
